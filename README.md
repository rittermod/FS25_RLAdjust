- Format: [xx-yy:yy:yy:yy] -> xx: overall genetics 00-99, yy:yy:yy:yy: individual traits
- Compatible with dealer, farm, and trailer animal interfaces + in-game menu

### Pregnancy System
- Randomized father selection from eligible candidates, instead of the first available
- Alternative genetic calculations for offspring traits
